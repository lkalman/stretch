# Operations with phonological representations

## Autosegmental representation

The utilities here define abstraction on a type of *tabular*
representation similar to autosegmental phonological representations.

## Grapheme representation to autosegmental representations

The utilities also include a converter from (Hungarian) graphemic
repesentations to the tabular representation defined.
